# Pint

Pint is a simple lint tool for PowerShell. It can be used to sanity-check PowerShell source for parse errors and other issues when building a project, 
without executing any PowerShell code. 

It depends on PowerShell 3.0 because it uses the PowerShell parser API which was introduced in that release.
